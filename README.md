Hello, my audience. I welcome you to my repository containing a few poems I randomly laid down—mostly wherever was convenient, usually in a note-making app. The topics are spontaneous, born from a spark I feel once in a blue moon. Poems are stored as plain text files, intended primarily for reading and sharing.

Feel free to read and share the poems. If you'd like to quote or reuse them, please credit me — "ComplexCorsair" — and follow the license terms.
