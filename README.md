# silly-poems-of-mine
Hello, my audience. I welcome you to my repository containing a few poems I randomly laid down, anywhere convenient, mostly in a note-making app. The topics of the poem are random, just some spark I feel once in a blue moon. The poems will be stored as plain text files, intended primarily for reading and sharing the poems.

Feel free to read and share the poems. If youâ€™d like to quote or reuse them, please credit the author according to the license terms.
