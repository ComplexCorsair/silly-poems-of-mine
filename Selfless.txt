Title: Selfless
Date: 20/04/2025 (DD/MM/YYYY)


Do you long for warmth? I do.
I am selfish.
I want to feel satiated.
I want my desires fulfilled.
I want to feel human again.
How beautiful it would be, as my misery melts away in her arms.
Flowing out of me, through her body, to the ground, to never appear again.
Never.
Never.
I will feel the soft lips on mine. We will shyly look at each other, with a faint embarrassed smile.
Wrapped around each other's arms.
I'd move my head forward, touch her nose and forehead with mine. We close our eyes. We forget everything. Everything.
No indecency. Yet no decency.
The ecstasy born purely out of the faint touch of our skins.
Her form is ever changing. She doesn't exist while she does.
Beyond everyone's comprehension, but her cheeks just between my palms.
Above and beyond. Beauty and salvation. Beauty no one understands. I don't either. So I let no one else understand.
For me, to me, one with me.
Till the end of time.
I finally become complete.
I reach my end goal.
To be beyond the world.
Who am I referring to? I don't know myself. She does not exist.
But my sanity does as long as she does.
And my sanity does exist.
She also does.
Beauty down from heavens gifted to me only.
The only time I want to be truly selfish.
