Nature's gift to me, only place where I can truly rest - your lap. No human creation, no divine contraption can match the excellence of this softness and warmth, Perfectly tanned to get every neuron of mine intriguied, All my miniscule lexicon can grasp is velvet, when the question is of comfort, and you make me speechless. Perfectly plump to not be mistaken for artifical, yet is as unreal as a mirage. This somatic landscape, for me to be content with, is of absolute flawlessness. This is how you make me feel â€” speechless with a thousand words. To be blunt or not to be, yet, to put it bluntly, I want you. I want this divine intervention in the creation of everything. I want to merge with your excellence, be one with the unfathomable perfection. Our souls bonded together pierce through the heavens and dissipate into the oblivion, never to be seen again by anything except each other of us. So complete, fulfilled, absolute, undivided and undividable. Thus I grasp the soul of the purpose, the uncertain, the game of fate. The destination awaits me, and I await the reciprocation, speechless, yet exhausting every inch of mine.
