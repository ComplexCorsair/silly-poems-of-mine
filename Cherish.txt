We're getting old, aren't we?
If you think about the good old Discord days
Everyone is so busy now, compared to that
And it will get worse
Much worse
Probably to a point where you'd have lost everyone.
Just a handful of 'family' will be all that you have.
All that I will have.
And it's uncertain, how soon that will come
To what extent you'd be left to be only with yourself
Will you be content with only yourself though?
Probably yes, with time you'll learn.
I wonder what taste that fateful isolation will leave in our mouths.
Whether we'll be even able to remotely cherish the past long gone.
Whether we'll even consider this treasure called 'memories' as treasure in the near future.
This treasure, that fate, crumb by crumb laid on the seemingly unending path we've been walking on, and will be walking on.
Did you even understand what those crumbs were meant to be to you? 
Have you understood yet?
Think about it.
