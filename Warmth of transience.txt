Name: Warmth of transience
Date: 23/05/2025

As I hug you tightly, can you hear my heart beat?
I hope you can, I really do.
Remember that it beats for you, all of what consists you.
It beats for everyone, to see the smiles,
Smiles which I will carry as the only treasure I need.
It may not seem like it,
But the beating is fading, with time it is.
(I am as transient as the shape of a cloud)
I do not understand whether to resist
Or to cherish.
It is only a part of mine.
A part whose value I can not seem to be able to comprehend at this very moment.
Maybe I want it to stop beating.
But remember, no matter how faint it gets,
It won't stop doing what it has been doing since the beginning.
(I will be reborn, or is it a return?)
Wishing everyone happiness,
Hoping for a bright future,
Bright enough to blind us of all the unfortunate, for just a moment at least.
(Nonetheless, I hopefully will greet you again)
As you feel my bodily warmth right now,
I hope you do,
And as you do not feel it anymore,
When I grow distant,
The skin of mine grows thicker.
It will continue to, I believe.
But remember, no matter how faint it gets,
It won't stop doing what it has been doing since the beginning.
(How much will I supress it? I will be reborn again, regardless)
So whenever you find yourself unwanted,
Understand that this shard of my conscience will hold onto you,
Till you gain the strength again,
To see your patience and resilience bear fruit.
(A cycle of greetings and farewells)
Let me live in you, with you, through you.
And let me help you live, to see the light.
Thank you for giving me purpose.
